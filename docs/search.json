    "text": "vHTP Import GUI\n\n\n\n\nImporting and managing EEG files can be a complex task, especially when working with different recording systems and directories. The vHTP Import Utility is a MATLAB tool designed to simplify this process by providing an easy-to-use interface for importing various raw EEG formats into the EEGLAB SET format. It also allows for moving SET files from subdirectories based on keywords. Following import a detailed filelist in CSV format is generated for easy reference.\n\n\n\n\nImport from various raw EEG formats: The vHTP Import Utility supports the import of EEG files from different formats, making it easy to work with files collected using different EEG systems.\nMove set files from subdirectories: The utility allows users to move set files from subdirectories, providing better organization and easier access for analysis.\nFilter files based on keywords: Users can specify keywords to filter the imported\nGenerate a detailed filelist: The utility generates a detailed filelist in CSV format, making it easy to reference and share information about the imported files.\n\n\n\n\nThe vHTP import utility is a MATLAB AppDesigner application. The underlying code is written in MATLAB and uses both custom code and EEGLAB toolbox for importing and managing EEG files. The utility is designed to be used with the vHTP EEG Preprocessing Pipeline, but can also be used as a standalone tool.\n\n\n\nThe vHTP Import Utility is distributed with the vHTP EEG Pipeline. You can either download a zip file from Github repository or use the git commandline tool to clone the repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/cincibrainlab/vhtp.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhtp “Doctor”\n\n\nTo simplify the process of installation, we have created a commandline utility called htpDoctor. The “doctor” checks your system to verify any needed toolkits, plugins, or dependencies for a functional vHTP install. If any of the required toolkits are missing, the htpDoctor provides several automatic fixing options.\n\n\nThe htpDoctor is a commandline utility that can be run from the MATLAB command window.\nAfter downloading the vHTP EEG Pipeline, navigate to the vHTP directory and run the htpDoctor from the MATLAB command window:\nhtpDoctor;\n\n\n\n\nToolkit Verification: The htpDoctor performs a series of checks to verify the availability and installation of essential toolkits such as EEGlab, Brainstorm, Biosig, BRAPH, and BCT (Brain Connectivity Toolbox).

It shows the filename and subfolder for each file.\n\n\n\n\nThe vHTP pipeline import functions serve as a wrapper for specific toolboxes. For example, the tool can import mouse multielectrode array (MEA) data and uses a custom function provided by the manufacturer. Other functions are implemented via EEGLAB and the Biosig plugin.\nWe have implemented import functions for the following EEG systems:\n\nEGI Hydrocel 128 (EGI128): This system from Electrical Geodesics Inc. (EGI) uses a HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net with 128 electrodes.\nEGI Hydrocel 32 (EGI32): 32-electrode HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net.\nEGI Hydrocel 64 (EGI64): 64-electrode HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net.\nMEA 30 (MEA30): Neuronexus murine MEA 30 system.\nMEARHD32: Variant of the MEA 30 system with 32 channels.\nBrainvision NIRS (BVNIRS): This is a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) joint EEG system from Brainvision, which can measure brain activity based on changes in blood oxygenation and volume.\nBrainvision 64 (BV64): This is a 64-channel EEG system from Brainvision.\nEDF Generic (EDFGENERIC): General EDF format. This is a generic format that can be used for a variety of EEG systems.\nMEA 30 DAT (MEA3ODAT): Variant of the MEA 30 system using DAT extension.\nEEGLAB SET (SET): EEG data stored in the format used by EEGLAB, a popular MATLAB toolbox for EEG analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe tool is designed to only import one type of EEG system and channel montage at a time. If you have multiple EEG systems, you will need to run the tool multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adding custom import functions or channel montages, feel free to contact our team. The the process involves adding a custom routine to the util_htpimportEeg.m and updating the cfg_htpEegSystems.xml with channel details. The dropdown menu will automatically update with the new system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the directory containing the EGI 128 Channel RAW files you want to import. You can use the “Search subfolders” checkbox to include subfolders in the search.\n\n\n\n\nFolder of Raw Files\n\n\n\nSelect the directory where you want to save the converted SET files.\nSelect “EGI 128 Channel” from the “Select EEG System” dropdown list.\nClick the “Scan Files” button to scan the directory for EEG files. The file list table will be updated with the results of the scan.\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n\n\n\nClick the “Test Import” button to perform a test import of the selected files. The import results will be displayed in the MATLAB Command Window.\nClick the “Convert to SET” button to start the actual import process. The converted SET files will be saved in the output directory. The MATLAB console window will display the import operation details.\nClick the “Open Input and Output Folder” button to open the input and output directories in the file explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport Results\n\n\n\nResults: The output directory will contain the converted SET files (see #1).\nChannel Locations: The output directory will also contain a image file containing a topoplot of the 2d channel locations. Use this image to confirm that the channel montage is correct (see #2).\nFile List: The file list in CSV format of the files that were imported is also saved in the output directory (see #3).\n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, you may want to “import” SET files from one location to another without any conversion. This may be useful for moving batches of SET files out of a directory of BIDS structures. The generated CSV file can be used to load SET files for serial processing.\nIn this example, we will import SET files from a directory of BIDS structures into a single directory. We will use the “Key Word Filter” to select only the files we want to import to only import files with “VEP” in the filename.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRather than do a file copy function, we have opted to load the SET file using the EEGLAB function pop_loadset(). This allows us to check the integrity of the SET file and ensure that it is not corrupted. The record of this import will be available in the MATLAB Command Window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIDS Example\n\n\n\nSelect the directory containing the BIDS structures you want to import. Here we select a folder with a BIDS structure containing multiple EEGs for a single subject. This may also include a folder with multiple subjects. Also, select the directory where you want to save the converted SET files.\nBy leaving the “Ignore Subfolders” checkbox unchecked, the vHTP Import Tool will scan all subfolders for EEG files.\nEnter a keyword term to filter the file list. Only files containing the keyword in their names will be imported. Here we use “VEP” to only import files with “VEP” in the filename.\nThe “Negate Filter” checkbox can be used to invert the filtering logic. Files that do not contain the specified keyword will be imported.\nSelect “SET Files” from the “Select EEG System” dropdown list. This will move the SET files from the BIDS structure to the output directory without any conversion.\nClick the “Scan Files” button to scan the directory for EEG files. The file list table will be updated with the results of the scan.\nClick the “Convert to SET” button to start the actual import process. The converted SET files will be saved in the output directory.\n\n\n\n\nThe vHTP Import Tool is a utility for converting to SET files. In some cases, it may be used to move SET files from one location to another. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a consistent interface for importing EEG files from different systems. It is also designed to be extensible, so that custom import functions and channel montages can be added to the utility.\nThe result of the tool is a set of SET files that can be loaded into EEGLAB for further processing. The tool also generates a CSV file containing a list of the imported files. A channel montage image is also generated for checking the channel locations."

This may be useful for moving batches of SET files out of a directory of BIDS structures. The generated CSV file can be used to load SET files for serial processing.\nIn this example, we will import SET files from a directory of BIDS structures into a single directory.

    "text": "The vHTP Import Tool is a utility for converting to SET files. In some cases, it may be used to move SET files from one location to another. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a consistent interface for importing EEG files from different systems. It is also designed to be extensible, so that custom import functions and channel montages can be added to the utility.\nThe result of the tool is a set of SET files that can be loaded into EEGLAB for further processing. The tool also generates a CSV file containing a list of the imported files. A channel montage image is also generated for checking the channel locations."

    "text": "The vHTP pipeline import functions serve as a wrapper for specific toolboxes. For example, the tool can import mouse multielectrode array (MEA) data and uses a custom function provided by the manufacturer. Other functions are implemented via EEGLAB and the Biosig plugin.\nWe have implemented import functions for the following EEG systems:\n\nEGI Hydrocel 128 (EGI128): This system from Electrical Geodesics Inc. (EGI) uses a HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net with 128 electrodes.\nEGI Hydrocel 32 (EGI32): 32-electrode HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net.\nEGI Hydrocel 64 (EGI64): 64-electrode HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net.\nMEA 30 (MEA30): Neuronexus murine MEA 30 system.\nMEARHD32: Variant of the MEA 30 system with 32 channels.\nBrainvision NIRS (BVNIRS): This is a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) joint EEG system from Brainvision, which can measure brain activity based on changes in blood oxygenation and volume.\nBrainvision 64 (BV64): This is a 64-channel EEG system from Brainvision.\nEDF Generic (EDFGENERIC): General EDF format. This is a generic format that can be used for a variety of EEG systems.\nMEA 30 DAT (MEA3ODAT): Variant of the MEA 30 system using DAT extension.\nEEGLAB SET (SET): EEG data stored in the format used by EEGLAB, a popular MATLAB toolbox for EEG analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe tool is designed to only import one type of EEG system and channel montage at a time. If you have multiple EEG systems, you will need to run the tool multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in adding custom import functions or channel montages, feel free to contact our team. The the process involves adding a custom routine to the util_htpimportEeg.m and updating the cfg_htpEegSystems.xml with channel details. The dropdown menu will automatically update with the new system."
